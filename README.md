# AISC @ UC San Diego — Artificial Intelligence Student Collective

Welcome to the official website for AISC @ UCSD, a student-led organization driven by the mission to make **AI literacy accessible for everyone**. This project represents our passion, purpose, and people—designed to inform, inspire, and engage a national community of learners, builders, and changemakers.

## Our Mission

Artificial Intelligence is transforming every part of our lives—from healthcare and education to ethics and creativity. At AISC, we believe that **AI shouldn't be exclusive**. Everyone should have the tools, knowledge, and community to participate in shaping the future of this powerful technology.

- **Next.js** for a blazing-fast, scalable frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive UI design.
- **TypeScript** for safer and smarter development.
- **Pure CSS visual effects** to simulate immersive AI-inspired environments (like our nebula backgrounds).
- **Dynamic event rendering** via JSON, so anyone can contribute and update content easily.

## Key Features
