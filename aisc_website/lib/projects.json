    "cardDescription": "This project uses computer vision to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their features",
    "modalDescription": "Ever wondered which mushrooms are safe to eat? This project uses computer vision to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their features. By analyzing images of mushrooms, we can help foragers and nature enthusiasts make informed decisions about which mushrooms are safe to consume. The model is trained on a dataset of mushroom images, and it learns to identify key characteristics that distinguish edible mushrooms from their poisonous counterparts.",
